# Project: Bikehorn

Project Bikehorn is a content pack for Toontown Rewritten that aims to enhance the experience as faithfully as possible by using the original resolution textures released as part of the "Spotify" repository.

The result is a near 1:1 idea of what a faithful modern day Toontown could've looked like, staying as true as possible to the original game.

***NOTE: DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LARGE TEXTURE SIZES OF THIS PACK, THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE OF LAG ON MID-TO-LOW-RANGE PCS. INTEL HD GRAPHICS CARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE USED WHEN RUNNING THIS PACK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

***This is the Toontown Online resources branch. For the TTR content pack, please see the Toontown Rewritten branch.***

# FAQ

**Q:** How do I install this?

**A:** Grab a copy of the ZIP in the Releases section. Go to your Toontown Rewritten installation directory and make a new folder called "resources", and put the .mf file from the ZIP in the new folder you've created. Start the game, go into the Video section of the options, scroll all the way down, enable "Project: Bikehorn", and finally hit "Apply".

**Q:** How compatible is this source with other projects (Open Toontown for example)?

**A:** This branch is compatible with Toontown Online's textures, while still containing the fixes and improvements. It will be updated for closer visual parity to TTO as it existed before closure (gold bean bank, etc.). This branch is the one you would use for non-Rewritten assets (Open Toontown, Schoolhouse, etc.).

If you wish to use these textures on Toontown Rewritten, please see the main branch.

**Q:** I found an issue/want to contribute!

**A:** Go ahead! This project is open sourced for that exact reason. Open an issue/pull request and I'll review it.

**Q:** Can I use _____?

**A:** Go right ahead, no need for permission at all but credit would be nice.

My only request is that you don't steal the credit for yourself or anyone else. I worked on this pack for about 3 whole years, and in that time I had to deal with a lot of issues with even just publishing the pack...so for something like that to happen wouldn't be right under any circumstances.

**Q:** Some things look a bit different from the original game. Why is that?

**A:** To enhance the experience slightly, I've made some personal edits to parts of the pack to fix some minor oversights and overall bring it closer to what I believe Disney intended.

The things changed are:

* Flipped Bossbot/Sellbot arms/legs to be consistent with the other Cog types
* Fixed Lawbot HQ scale not displaying the emblem
* Update the vanilla battle menu to correctly include the Fires icon
* Fix a poor quality removal of a small light on the Donald's Dreamland skybox that caused a small seam in the texture
* Remastered Bossbot HQ/Toon Hall portraits using color corrected and tweaked scans of the original Trading Cards
* Fixes to a large variety of RGB issues caused by faulty TIF files in the original model repository, such as Estates and Catching Game

It's also possible that I made a mistake. In which case, please open an issue/pull request if possible!

**Q:** Will this continue to be updated?

**A:** Of course! There's still some minor issues to work out, so please open an issue if you see something (or contact me on Discord).

**Q:** Does this make any use of upscaling?

**A:** *For the most part,* no. Because Spotify dates to around 2008, many textures for content like Field Offices or the Silly Meter are missing, and possibly even lost to time. So for these cases, I opted to use AI upscaling using ESRGAN. Most (but not all) textures use [HDCube](https://github.com/Venomalia/HDcube). While it's designed around GameCube textures (which it looks fantastic on), it worked remarkably well on anything missing from Spotify. So in the interest of keeping a consistently clean picture throughout, I decided to use upscaling and manual editing for anything missing.

For the record, ***I will (mostly, see eye textures and TTR Toon Hall) not be adding upscales to anything that isn't already part of a palette at this time.*** It might come later, but for now, I'm keeping it strictly to anything already palettized that doesn't have an HD equivalent.
